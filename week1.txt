Justin
I want to get deep enough into coding to be sure it's what I want to do next.
My current occupation I would say is figuring out what to do next.  Or maybe funemployed, if that's a thing.
A british clown taught me to juggle clubs in brazil
I would build a ruby app that plans my dinner and emails me what I need to buy for that dinner
